## What Are Macros?

**Macronutrients** (macros) are the three nutrients your body needs in large amounts. Learn more about [what macronutrients are and what they do](/blog/what-are-macros).

## Why Track Macros (Not Just Calories)?

You can lose weight eating 2,000 calories of pizza or 2,000 calories of chicken and vegetables. **But your body composition will be completely different.**

Tracking macros ensures you're eating enough:

- **Protein** to preserve muscle mass while losing fat
- **Carbs** to fuel workouts and recovery
- **Fat** for hormones, brain health, and satiety

*Calories determine weight change. Macros determine body composition.*

## Common Macro Splits

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Important:</strong> These macro splits are general guidelines. Individual needs vary based on activity level, goals, body composition, and health conditions. What works for one person may not work for another. Consider consulting with a registered dietitian for personalized macro recommendations.
</div>

### Balanced (30% Protein, 40% Carbs, 30% Fat)

**Best for:** General health, maintenance, beginners

A well-rounded split that works for most people. Enough protein to support muscle, enough carbs for energy, enough fat for hormones.

### High Protein (40% Protein, 30% Carbs, 30% Fat)

**Best for:** Fat loss, muscle gain, active individuals

Higher protein helps preserve muscle during a calorie deficit and supports muscle growth when in a surplus. Most lifters and athletes use this split. *Note: Always consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian before starting a fat loss diet or making significant changes to your nutrition.*

### Low Carb (35% Protein, 20% Carbs, 45% Fat)

**Best for:** Low-carb dieters, insulin resistance, appetite control

Prioritizes fat for energy instead of carbs. Can help with satiety and blood sugar control, but may impact high-intensity workout performance.

### Keto (25% Protein, 5% Carbs, 70% Fat)

**Best for:** Ketogenic dieters, specific medical conditions

Very low carb to induce ketosis. Requires strict tracking and isn't necessary for fat loss—it's a preference or medical strategy, not a requirement.

## Calculate Your Macros

Before calculating your macros, you'll need to know your [TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)](/blog/how-to-calculate-tdee). If you haven't calculated it yet, use our TDEE calculator first.

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This calculator provides estimates for informational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice. Macro calculations are based on general guidelines and may not be appropriate for your individual needs. Always consult a healthcare provider or registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes.
</div>

## How Much Protein Do You Need?

The most important macro to get right. [General guidelines](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/):

- **Sedentary adults:** 0.6-0.8g per lb of bodyweight (or 1.2-1.6g per kg)
- **Active individuals:** 0.8-1g per lb of bodyweight
- **Building muscle:** 1-1.2g per lb of bodyweight
- **Fat loss + muscle preservation:** 1-1.2g per lb of bodyweight

<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-5 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="mb-2 font-semibold">Example (180 lb person building muscle):</p>
  <ul class="space-y-1 mb-0">
    <li>Protein: 180 × 1g = <strong>180g per day</strong></li>
    <li>At 4 calories/gram = <strong>720 calories from protein</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

**Note:** If you're significantly overweight, use your *goal weight* or *lean body mass* instead of current weight for protein calculations.

## Carbs vs Fat: What's the Right Balance?

Once you've set protein, the remaining calories come from carbs and fat. The split depends on:

### Choose Higher Carbs If:

- You do high-intensity workouts (CrossFit, HIIT, heavy lifting)
- You're an endurance athlete (running, cycling, swimming)
- You feel low energy on low-carb diets
- You have good insulin sensitivity

### Choose Higher Fat If:

- You prefer low-carb eating
- You do lower-intensity activity (walking, yoga, light weights)
- You feel fuller eating more fats

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> If you have insulin resistance, PCOS, or other metabolic conditions, work with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate macronutrient distribution for your specific medical needs. These conditions require individualized nutritional guidance, not general recommendations.
</div>

**Truth:** For fat loss, the carb/fat ratio matters less than total calories and protein. Choose what you enjoy and can stick to long-term.

## How to Track Your Macros

Knowing your macro targets is step one. **Tracking them consistently is step two.**

Free Calorie Track makes macro tracking simple:

- ✅ Set custom macro goals (or use calculated targets)
- ✅ See real-time progress bars for protein, carbs, and fat
- ✅ Barcode scanning pulls accurate macro data
- ✅ Meal categories help balance intake throughout the day
- ✅ No premium paywall—macro tracking is free

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to hit my macros exactly every day?

No. Aim for weekly averages, not daily perfection. If you're within 5-10g of your targets most days, you're fine.

### What if I go over one macro but under another?

As long as total calories are on track, it's not a big deal occasionally. Protein is the most important to hit consistently.

### Should I track fiber separately?

Fiber is a type of carbohydrate. Most trackers include it in total carbs. Aim for 25-35g fiber per day for digestive health, but it doesn't need separate tracking.

### Can I eat anything as long as it fits my macros (IIFYM)?

Technically yes—you can lose weight eating junk food if calories/macros match your goals. *But* you'll feel better, perform better, and be healthier eating mostly whole foods. Use the 80/20 rule: 80% nutrient-dense foods, 20% whatever you enjoy.
