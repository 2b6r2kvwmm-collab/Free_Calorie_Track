After outgrowing my [Core Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells](/blog/best-adjustable-dumbbells-beginners) (which max out at 50 lbs), I upgraded to [these heavy-duty adjustables](https://amzn.to/4qU7fJY). If you're an intermediate to advanced lifter who needs more weight, these are the best adjustable dumbbells on the market.

## Why I Upgraded

The Core Fitness dumbbells were great—until I started hitting 50 lbs regularly on dumbbell bench press and rows. Once you're maxing out the weight on every set, it's time to upgrade. I needed something that could go heavier without sacrificing the convenience of adjustables.

## What Makes These the Best Adjustable Dumbbells

### 1. Goes Up to 80 lbs (in 5 lb Increments)

The key difference between these and most other adjustables is the weight range. These go from 5 lbs all the way up to **80 lbs per dumbbell**, adjustable in 5 lb increments. That's 16 different weight settings—enough to handle heavy pressing, rowing, and even some single-arm movements that require serious load.

### 2. Excellent Twist-to-Select System

These use a twist mechanism to select weight. When the dumbbell is in the cradle, you twist the handle to your desired weight, and it locks in instantly. No pins, no fuss. It's fast, intuitive, and reliable.

### 3. Highly Compact Design

Despite going up to 80 lbs, these are surprisingly compact. They don't feel like you're holding a small barbell at lower weights, and they stay balanced across the entire range. This is a huge advantage over traditional plate-loaded adjustables that get awkwardly long.

### 4. Textured Steel Grips (Gym-Quality Feel)

The handles have textured steel grips, similar to what you'd find on commercial gym dumbbells. They're not rubberized like some home dumbbells—they're actual knurled steel. This gives you a solid, secure grip, even when your hands are sweaty during heavy sets. It feels professional.

### 5. All Metal Plates

The weight plates are all metal, which contributes to the solid, high-quality feel. Unlike some adjustables that use rubber-coated or composite plates, these feel like real gym equipment.

### 6. Minimal Chatter

For adjustable dumbbells, these have impressively minimal plate chatter. There's still a tiny bit of movement (that's unavoidable with adjustables), but it's far less noticeable than on cheaper models. During heavy lifts, they feel almost as solid as fixed-weight dumbbells.

## The One Thing People Complain About (That Doesn't Bother Me)

### Plastic Base

Some reviewers complain that the base (the cradle that holds the dumbbells) is made of plastic rather than metal. I've seen this criticism, and I get why people might assume plastic = cheaper quality. But here's the thing: I've had zero durability issues. The base is thick, sturdy plastic—not flimsy at all—and I actually appreciate that it makes the overall setup lighter and easier to move around. If it were solid metal, the whole thing would weigh a ton and be harder to reposition in a home gym.

## Who Should Buy These?

These adjustable dumbbells are perfect for:

- **Intermediate to advanced lifters** who regularly use 50+ lb dumbbells
- **Home gym owners** who don't have space for a full commercial dumbbell rack
- **People who want gym-quality adjustables** with minimal chatter and solid construction
- **Lifters who value convenience**—the twist mechanism makes weight changes seamless

If you're just starting out or only need weights up to 50 lbs, the [Core Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells](/blog/best-adjustable-dumbbells-beginners) are a more affordable option. But if you need heavy dumbbells and want the best adjustables money can buy, these are it.

## Bottom Line

These are the best adjustable dumbbells I've used. The 80 lb max weight, textured steel grips, minimal chatter, and compact design make them feel like premium gym equipment. The twist-to-select mechanism is fast and reliable, and the build quality is excellent. If you're serious about lifting at home and need heavy dumbbells, these are worth every penny.
