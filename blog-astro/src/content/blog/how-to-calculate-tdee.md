## What Is TDEE?

**TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)** is the total number of [calories](/blog/what-are-calories) your body burns in a 24-hour period. It's not just the calories you burn exercising—it's everything your body does to keep you alive and moving throughout the day.

Think of TDEE as your body's daily energy budget. Your body burns calories constantly:

- **While you sleep** - Heart beats, lungs breathe, brain functions
- **While you sit at your desk** - Digesting food, maintaining body temperature, cell repair
- **While you walk to the car** - Every movement burns extra calories
- **While you exercise** - Intentional physical activity adds even more

TDEE is your **maintenance calories**. If you eat exactly your TDEE in calories every day, your weight stays the same. Eat less, you lose weight. Eat more, you gain weight.

## The Four Components of TDEE

Your TDEE is made up of four parts:

### 1. BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - 60-75% of TDEE

- **What it is:** Calories burned keeping you alive at complete rest
- **Includes:** Breathing, circulation, cell production, nutrient processing
- **Example:** A 180 lb man might have a BMR of 1,800 calories

### 2. NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) - 15-30% of TDEE

- **What it is:** Calories burned from daily movement that isn't formal exercise
- **Includes:** Walking to your car, doing dishes, fidgeting, standing, climbing stairs
- **Varies widely:** Someone with a desk job burns way less NEAT than a construction worker

### 3. TEF (Thermic Effect of Food) - 10% of TDEE

- **What it is:** Calories burned digesting, absorbing, and processing food
- **Protein burns the most:** 20-30% of protein calories go to digestion
- **Already included:** Most TDEE calculators (including ours) factor TEF into your maintenance calories automatically, so you don't need to calculate it separately

### 4. Exercise - 5-10% of TDEE (varies)

- **What it is:** Intentional physical activity (gym, running, sports)
- **Often overestimated:** Most people think they burn more than they actually do
- **Hard to measure precisely:** Exact calorie burn varies by individual, but fitness trackers and heart rate monitors provide helpful estimates for tracking trends over time

## BMR vs TDEE: What's the Difference?

**BMR** is the baseline—what your body burns doing absolutely nothing. If you laid in bed all day without moving, you'd burn approximately your BMR in calories.

**TDEE** accounts for real life. You don't lie motionless in bed—you walk, work, exercise, and move throughout the day. TDEE multiplies your BMR by an activity factor to estimate your true daily burn.

<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-5 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="mb-2 font-semibold">Example:</p>
  <ul class="space-y-1 mb-0">
    <li>BMR: 1,800 calories (baseline metabolism)</li>
    <li>Activity Level: Moderate (exercise 3-5x/week)</li>
    <li>TDEE: 1,800 × 1.55 = <strong>2,790 calories/day</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

## How to Calculate TDEE

The most accurate method is the [Mifflin-St Jeor equation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2305711/), which calculates BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) based on age, sex, height, and weight. Then multiply BMR by your activity level.

### Step 1: Calculate BMR

**For Men:**

```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
```

**For Women:**

```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

### Step 2: Multiply by Activity Factor

- **Sedentary** (little to no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- **Light** (1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
- **Moderate** (3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
- **Active** (6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
- **Very Active** (intense daily exercise): BMR × 1.9

### How Free Calorie Track Calculates TDEE

Traditional TDEE calculators (including the calculator in this blog post) bake exercise into your activity level to give you a rough ballpark estimate. For example, if you select "Moderate (3-5 days/week exercise)," the calculator assumes you exercise that consistently and gives you one static TDEE number.

**Free Calorie Track uses a smarter approach in the app:**

- **Step 1:** Calculate your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) using your age, sex, height, and weight
- **Step 2:** Apply an activity multiplier based only on your daily lifestyle—NOT including intentional exercise
- **Step 3:** Add specific exercises separately when you actually log them each day

**Why this app approach is better:** Most people don't exercise the exact same amount every day. Free Calorie Track gives you a baseline TDEE for your daily activity, then adds exercise calories only on the days you actually work out. This gives you a dynamic, accurate picture of your true daily burn instead of a static estimate.

<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-5 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="mb-2 font-semibold">Example:</p>
  <ul class="space-y-1 mb-0">
    <li>BMR: 1,800 calories</li>
    <li>Activity Level: Light (desk job, some walking) → 1,800 × 1.375 = 2,475 baseline TDEE</li>
    <li>Monday workout: 300 calories burned → Total TDEE: 2,775 calories</li>
    <li>Tuesday (no workout) → Total TDEE: 2,475 calories</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## How to Use Your TDEE

Once you know your TDEE, you can set your calorie goal based on what you want to achieve:

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
  <div class="bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border-2 border-red-200 dark:border-red-800 rounded-lg p-4">
    <h4 class="text-red-700 dark:text-red-400 font-bold mt-0 mb-2">Fat Loss</h4>
    <p class="text-sm mb-0">Eat <strong>200-500 below</strong> TDEE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 border-2 border-green-200 dark:border-green-800 rounded-lg p-4">
    <h4 class="text-green-700 dark:text-green-400 font-bold mt-0 mb-2">Maintenance</h4>
    <p class="text-sm mb-0">Eat <strong>at your TDEE</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg p-4">
    <h4 class="text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400 font-bold mt-0 mb-2">Muscle Gain</h4>
    <p class="text-sm mb-0">Eat <strong>200-500 above</strong> TDEE</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Is TDEE 100% Accurate?

No. TDEE calculations are **estimates** based on population averages. Your actual TDEE can vary due to:

- **Genetics:** Some people have faster or slower metabolisms
- **Muscle mass:** Muscle burns more calories than fat (about 6 cal/lb vs 2 cal/lb)
- **Hormones:** Thyroid issues, PCOS, menopause, etc. can affect metabolism
- **NEAT variation:** Fidgeting and spontaneous movement vary wildly between people
- **Medication:** Certain medications can increase or decrease metabolism
- **Adaptive thermogenesis:** Your body adapts to prolonged calorie restriction

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> If you have thyroid disorders, PCOS, metabolic conditions, or take medications that affect metabolism, standard TDEE calculators may not be accurate for your individual needs. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized guidance on determining your calorie requirements.
</div>

### Solution: Adjust Based on Results

Use your calculated TDEE as a starting point, then adjust based on results. Track your weight for 2-3 weeks:

- **Losing faster than expected?** Increase calories by 100-200
- **Not losing weight?** Decrease calories by 100-200
- **Weight staying stable?** You're at your true TDEE

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Before making significant changes to your diet or calorie intake, consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian. This is especially important if you have any medical conditions, are taking medications, or have a history of disordered eating.
</div>

## Track Against Your TDEE with Free Calorie Track

Now that you know your TDEE, you need a way to track whether you're eating above, below, or at your target. Free Calorie Track calculates your TDEE automatically during setup and shows your **net calories**—the most important number for weight management.

<div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-5 rounded-lg my-6">
  <p class="mb-2 font-semibold">Net Calories Formula:</p>
  <p class="font-mono text-sm mb-0">
    Net Calories = Food Eaten - TDEE - Exercise Burned
  </p>
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 mb-0">
    A negative net means you're in a deficit (losing weight). A positive net means surplus (gaining weight).
  </p>
</div>

**Free Calorie Track includes:**

- ✅ Automatic TDEE calculation
- ✅ Net calorie tracking
- ✅ Barcode scanning for food
- ✅ 250+ exercise database
- ✅ Macro tracking (protein, carbs, fat)
- ✅ Works 100% offline
