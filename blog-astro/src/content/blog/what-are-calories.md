## What Is a Calorie?

A **calorie** is a unit of measurement for energy. Specifically, one calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.

When we talk about food calories, we're actually talking about **kilocalories** (1,000 calories = 1 kilocalorie). So when a food label says "200 calories," it technically means 200 kilocalories, or 200,000 actual calories. But for simplicity, everyone just says "calories."

Your body uses calories (energy) for everything:

- **Keeping you alive:** Breathing, heart beating, brain functioning, cell repair
- **Digesting food:** Breaking down and processing nutrients
- **Moving around:** Walking, standing, fidgeting, exercising
- **Growing and recovering:** Building muscle, healing injuries, fighting illness

## Where Do Calories Come From?

Calories come from three macronutrients in food:

- **Protein:** 4 calories per gram (chicken, fish, eggs, tofu)
- **Carbohydrates:** 4 calories per gram (bread, rice, fruit, vegetables)
- **Fat:** 9 calories per gram (oils, butter, nuts, avocado)

Alcohol also provides 7 calories per gram, but it's not a macronutrient because your body doesn't use it for nutrition. Learn more about [what macronutrients are and what they do](/blog/what-are-macros).

## How Does Weight Loss Actually Work?

Weight management comes down to **energy balance**:

    <p class="text-sm mb-0">Eat more calories than you burn → <strong>Gain weight</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

This isn't opinion—it's physics. Your body can't create energy out of nothing. For most healthy individuals, consistently eating in a calorie deficit typically leads to weight loss over time. However, individual results vary based on metabolism, hormones, medical conditions, and medications. If you have concerns or aren't seeing expected results, consult a healthcare provider. The challenge isn't the science; it's the consistency.

### What About Maintenance and Gaining Muscle?

**Maintenance:** If your goal is to maintain your current weight, eat at your [TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)](/blog/how-to-calculate-tdee). This is your maintenance calories—the amount your body burns each day. Track for a few weeks to dial it in, then you can stop tracking if you want. Weighing yourself weekly helps confirm you're staying stable.

<div class="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-4 my-6 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
  <strong>Important:</strong> These are general guidelines for healthy adults. Consult a healthcare provider or registered dietitian before starting a muscle-building program, especially if you have kidney disease, metabolic conditions, or other health concerns.
</div>

**Gaining Lean Muscle:** To build muscle, you need to eat in a slight calorie surplus (200-500 above TDEE) combined with strength training. But here's the key: eat too much and you'll gain mostly fat. A common approach is a small surplus with high [protein intake](/blog/what-are-macros) (1-1.2g per pound of body weight), aiming to gain 0.5-1 lb per week. Faster weight gain may indicate you're gaining more fat alongside muscle.

## What Is Calorie Tracking?

Calorie tracking is the practice of logging the food you eat and monitoring how many calories you consume each day. Most people use an app to:

- Search for foods or scan barcodes
- Log portions and serving sizes
- See their total calories for the day
- Compare their intake to their calorie goal

## Why Does Calorie Tracking Work?

Calorie tracking works for three main reasons:

### 1. It Creates Awareness

Most people have no idea how many calories they eat. [Studies show people underestimate their intake by 30-50%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1454084/). When you track, you see the truth. That "small" muffin? 500 calories. That "healthy" salad with dressing, cheese, and croutons? 800 calories.

### 2. It Creates Accountability

When you know you'll have to log it, you think twice. Do you really want that third slice of pizza? Logging makes you pause and make conscious choices instead of mindlessly eating.

### 3. It Removes Guesswork

"Am I eating too much? Too little? Why isn't the scale moving?" Calorie tracking gives you data. If you're not losing weight, the numbers tell you exactly why. No more mystery. Adjust your intake and track the results.

## Common Myths About Calorie Tracking

### Myth 1: "All calories are equal"

For weight loss, yes—200 calories of broccoli and 200 calories of cookies both affect your weight the same way. But for health, nutrition, hunger, and muscle preservation? Not at all. [Macronutrients matter](/blog/what-are-macros). Protein keeps you full and preserves muscle. Fiber-rich carbs provide sustained energy. Healthy fats support hormones. So track calories *and* pay attention to food quality.

### Myth 2: "Calorie tracking is too much work"

It takes about 5-10 minutes per day once you get the hang of it. Barcode scanning makes it even faster—scan, log, done. Many people track for a few months to learn portion sizes, then stop. Others track long-term because it keeps them accountable and helps them maintain their results. Both approaches work. The key is finding what fits your lifestyle. Think of it like checking your bank account—it's just information that helps you make better decisions.

## How to Start Tracking Calories

Here's how to get started:

1. **Calculate your TDEE:** Use our [TDEE calculator](/blog/how-to-calculate-tdee) to find your maintenance calories
2. **Set your calorie goal:** Eat 200-500 below TDEE for fat loss, or at TDEE to maintain
3. **Choose a tracking app:** Free Calorie Track, MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, etc.
4. **Log everything for 2 weeks:** Get brutally honest about your intake
5. **Adjust as needed:** If you're not seeing results after 2-3 weeks, lower your calorie target by 100-200
