## What Are Macronutrients?

**Macronutrients** (macros) are the three types of nutrients your body needs in large amounts to function. Unlike micronutrients (vitamins and minerals, needed in small amounts), macros make up the bulk of your diet and provide all your calories.

The three macronutrients are:

## What Does Each Macro Do?

### Protein: The Building Block

Protein is made of amino acids, which are the building blocks your body uses to:

- **Build muscle:** Especially important during strength training or weight loss
- **Repair tissue:** Heals injuries, maintains skin, hair, and nails
- **Make enzymes and hormones:** Insulin, growth hormone, digestive enzymes
- **Support immune function:** Antibodies are made from protein

**Best sources:** Chicken, turkey, beef, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu, lentils, protein powder

### Carbohydrates: Your Body's Fuel

Carbohydrates break down into glucose (sugar), which your body uses for energy. Carbs are your body's preferred fuel source for:

- **Brain function:** Your brain runs almost entirely on glucose
- **Muscle energy:** Stored as glycogen in muscles for workouts
- **High-intensity exercise:** Lifting weights, sprinting, HIIT all rely on carbs
- **Daily activity:** Walking, thinking, basic movement

**Best sources:** Rice, oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes, bread, pasta, fruit, vegetables

### Fat: Essential for Hormones and Health

Dietary fat is crucial for your body to function properly. Fat is used for:

- **Hormone production:** Testosterone, estrogen, cortisol all require fat
- **Vitamin absorption:** Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble (you can't absorb them without fat)
- **Cell membranes:** Every cell in your body has a fatty outer layer
- **Brain health:** 60% of your brain is made of fat
- **Satiety:** Fat keeps you full longer than carbs or protein

**Focus on healthy fats:** Not all fats are equal. Prioritize unsaturated fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, fatty fish like salmon and mackerel) over saturated fats (butter, cheese, red meat). Trans fats (found in processed foods) should be avoided entirely. While dietary fat is essential, it's also calorie-dense at 9 calories per gram, so portion control matters. A little goes a long way.

**Best sources:** Olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), egg yolks, natural nut butters

## Why Track Macros (Not Just Calories)?

You can lose weight eating 2,000 [calories](/blog/what-are-calories) of junk food or 2,000 calories of whole foods. **But your body composition will be completely different.**

Here's why macros matter:

### 1. Protein Preserves Muscle

When you're in a calorie deficit, your body burns fat *and* muscle for energy. [High protein intake signals your body to spare muscle and burn mostly fat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23739654/). If you eat 2,000 calories with only 50g protein, you'll lose muscle and end up "skinny fat." If you eat 2,000 calories with 150g protein, you'll lose mostly fat and look lean.

### 2. Carbs Fuel Performance

If you're lifting weights, doing HIIT, or playing sports, you need carbs. Low-carb diets work fine for sedentary people, but active individuals perform better with adequate carbs. No carbs = flat muscles, low energy, poor workouts.

### 3. Fat Supports Overall Health

[Research suggests](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8942407/) that adequate dietary fat is essential for numerous body functions, including nutrient absorption (vitamins A, D, E, and K), cell structure, brain health, and hormone production. Very low-fat diets may lead to deficiencies and health issues over time. Fat also provides sustained energy and helps you feel full between meals. The key is getting enough fat from healthy sources rather than avoiding it altogether.

## How Much of Each Macro Do You Need?

  <strong>Important:</strong> These are general guidelines. Individual needs vary based on age, activity level, health conditions, and goals. Always consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your diet or macronutrient intake.
</div>

General guidelines for active individuals:

- **Protein:** 0.8-1.2g per pound of body weight (more if losing weight or building muscle)
- **Fat:** 0.3-0.5g per pound of body weight (minimum 50g/day for hormones)
- **Carbs:** Fill the rest of your calories with carbs

## Common Macro Tracking Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Prioritizing carbs and fat over protein

Protein is the most important macro for body composition. Hit your protein target first, then fill in carbs and fat. Don't sacrifice protein to fit in more carbs or fat.

### Mistake 2: Cutting fat too low

Fat-free diets sound good but wreck your hormones. Keep fat at least 0.3g/lb of body weight (50-70g/day for most people).

### Mistake 3: Obsessing over perfection

You don't need to hit your macros exactly every day. Aim for weekly averages. If you're within 5-10g of each target most days, you're fine.
