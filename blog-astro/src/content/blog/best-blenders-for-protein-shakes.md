I've been making [protein](/blog/what-are-macros) shakes almost every day for the past two years using my [NutriBullet Pro 900](https://amzn.to/4r0CClz). I actually own two of them. Here's my honest take after hundreds of shakes.

## Why I Chose the NutriBullet Pro 900

When I started tracking calories and hitting 150+ grams of protein daily, I needed a blender that wouldn't become a chore. I tried a few different models, but the NutriBullet Pro 900 hit the sweet spot for my needs: daily protein shakes with some frozen fruit, easy cleanup, and the ability to take it with me.

## What I Love About It

### 1. Cleanup Takes 30 Seconds

After blending, I rinse the blade under running water (30 seconds max) and the cup goes in the dishwasher or gets a quick rinse. There are no hidden crevices where protein powder gets stuck and turns into cement. This might sound trivial, but when you're making a shake every single day, cleanup time is the difference between consistency and giving up after two weeks.

### 2. Flatter Blades Are Safer and More Effective

The blades are flatter than traditional blender blades, which makes them safer to handle during cleanup. They also do an incredible job liquefying food—they completely break down things like chia seeds and flax seeds into the shake, so you don't get chunky bits.

### 3. Drink Straight From the Container

You blend directly in the portable cup, twist on a lid, and you're done. No pouring into another container, no extra dishes, no mess. I blend my shake, toss the cup in my bag with the lid on, and drink it on my commute or at my desk.

### 4. Perfect for Protein Shakes and Smoothies

The 900-watt motor handles typical protein shakes and smoothies with ease. It blends smooth in just a few seconds—no chunks. It can handle a moderate amount of frozen fruit (around 1 cup), though it can struggle if you overload it with too much frozen content. For daily shakes and smoothies, it's more than enough power. That said, if you're looking for something that can pulverize anything or handle prolonged high-intensity blending, this isn't a Vitamix replacement. It's designed for quick blending (under a minute) and excels at protein drinks and smoothies that are ready in seconds.

### 5. Looks Great on the Counter

I have one in black and one in matte jade, and both look great in the kitchen. The design is sleek and modern—it doesn't look like cheap plastic. I keep mine on the counter at all times, and it fits under most cabinets with a small footprint. I also appreciate that they come with multiple blender containers and a range of lids and handle options, which makes it versatile for different uses.

## The Drawbacks (Minor, But Worth Mentioning)

### 1. Gasket Pops Out on One Unit

I have two NutriBullet Pro 900s. On one of them, the rubber gasket that seals the blade assembly pops out almost every time I use it. I just push it back in, but it's slightly annoying. The other unit has been flawless for two years, so your experience may vary. Either way, it hasn't stopped me from using it daily.

### 2. Small Hole in Base Can Cause Issues

Here's a funny and perhaps unique problem: A bit of smoothie spilled down a small hole in the blender base on one of ours, and now there's a bad smell when we run the blender. It's minor and probably uncommon, but having that hole in the blender base is a small design flaw. Just be careful not to overfill or spill liquids near the base.

## My Favorite Protein Shake Recipe

This is what I make almost every morning. Comes out to about 400-450 calories, 35g protein, and tastes incredible:

  <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">My Go-To Protein Shake Recipe</h4>
  <ul class="space-y-2 mb-0">
    <li>1 banana</li>
    <li>1 scoop <a href="https://amzn.to/4aMIU20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ascent vanilla protein powder</a></li>
    <li>8oz unsweetened soy milk</li>
    <li>1 tbsp natural peanut butter</li>
    <li>2 tsp chia seeds</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground flax</li>
    <li>1/4 cup walnuts</li>
    <li>Small handful frozen spinach</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4 mb-0">
    Blend for 30 seconds. Tastes like a peanut butter banana milkshake, but with 35g protein and a ton of fiber. The spinach is completely undetectable.

## Tips for Better Shakes

1. **Liquid first:** Add milk or water before powder to prevent sticking at the bottom
2. **Add enough liquid:** If your shake is too thick to blend, add more liquid—start with at least 8oz
3. **Blend for at least 30 seconds:** Don't pulse or stop early. Let it run for a full 30 seconds to get smooth consistency
4. **Rinse immediately:** Don't let protein powder dry on the blades. Rinse within 5 minutes of blending for easiest cleanup
5. **Use frozen fruit sparingly:** 1/2 to 1 cup max if you want smooth blending without overworking the motor

## Bottom Line: Should You Buy It?

If you're making protein shakes regularly (3-7 times per week) and you want something that's easy to clean, portable, and handles moderate frozen fruit without issue, the [NutriBullet Pro 900](https://amzn.to/4r0CClz) is the best option I've found.

It's not the most powerful blender on the market, but for my needs—and probably yours if you're reading a calorie tracking blog—it's perfect. The easy cleanup alone makes it worth it. I've had mine for over two years, use them daily, and they're still going strong.
