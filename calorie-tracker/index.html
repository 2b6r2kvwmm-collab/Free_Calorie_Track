      <h1>Free Calorie Track - The Calorie & Macro Tracker That Stayed Truly Free</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>About Free Calorie Track</h2>
        <p>Free Calorie Track is a fast, privacy-first calorie and macro tracker with no paywalls, no accounts, and no ads. Track calories and macros, scan barcodes, edit past days, and see real trends — all for free, forever. Built by someone who actually tracks nutrition and was frustrated with the freemium model that gates essential features behind premium subscriptions.</p>

        <p>Unlike MyFitnessPal, Lose It, or other popular calorie tracking apps, Free Calorie Track offers complete functionality without requiring payment. Barcode scanning, macro tracking, trends, history editing, and data export are all included at no cost. No 'free tier' traps, no feature walls, no premium upgrades.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <h3>Truly Free - No Paywalls</h3>
        <p>Every feature is unlocked forever. Calories and macros fully tracked, barcode scanning included, trends and history editing available to all users. Competitors like MyFitnessPal gate barcode scanning behind $80/year premium subscriptions. Free Calorie Track believes essential nutrition tracking should be accessible to everyone.</p>

        <h3>Privacy by Design</h3>
        <p>No account required, no email signup, no password to remember. All data is stored locally on your device using browser storage. Your nutrition data, meal logs, exercise history, and personal information never leave your device unless you explicitly export it. This privacy-first approach means no cloud servers, no data breaches, no selling your information to advertisers.</p>

        <h3>Progressive Web App - App Experience Without App Stores</h3>
        <p>Free Calorie Track is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that installs on iPhone, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux without going through app stores. Add it to your home screen for a native app experience with instant loading, offline functionality, and no downloads. No platform lock-in, no waiting for app store approvals, no forced updates.</p>

        <h3>NET Calories Done Right</h3>
        <p>Calories in vs calories out is the core metric. Free Calorie Track calculates NET calories as: Food eaten - Lifestyle activity (TDEE) - Exercise logged. This shows your true calorie surplus or deficit. Zero NET calories = maintenance, negative = weight loss, positive = weight gain. Most apps obscure or misrepresent energy balance, but Free Calorie Track makes it transparent and honest.</p>

        <h3>Fast, Real-World Food Logging</h3>
        <p>Multiple food entry methods for speed: Scan barcodes with camera (220,000+ products), access 2,000+ instant common foods (no internet needed), search branded food database, view favorites and recent foods, create custom foods and recipes, copy yesterday's meals. Designed for people who actually track - fast workflows, no friction.</p>

        <h3>Edit History Without Punishment</h3>
        <p>Fully editable history for all past days. Missed a day? Forgot a meal? Made a mistake? Just fix it. No streak loss, no guilt mechanics, no restrictions. Free Calorie Track treats you like an adult who understands that tracking isn't perfect and mistakes happen.</p>

        <h3>Clear Trends That Actually Matter</h3>
        <p>View weekly and monthly averages for NET calories, protein, carbs, fat, and exercise burned. See 7-day rolling averages to smooth out daily fluctuations. Track weight progress over time with trend charts. Honest estimated weight change calculations based on energy balance. Trends are often paywalled in competitors - not here.</p>

        <h3>Exercise Tracking with 250+ Activities</h3>
        <p>Log workouts with comprehensive exercise database including cardio (running, cycling, swimming, walking), strength training (80+ exercises by body part), sports (basketball, soccer, tennis), HIIT and circuit training, yoga and flexibility, martial arts, water sports, and household activities. Exercise calories integrate with NET calorie calculations for accurate energy balance. Save workout templates for quick logging of regular routines.</p>

        <h3>Water Intake Tracking</h3>
        <p>Track daily hydration with quick-add buttons for 8oz, 16oz, 32oz (or 250mL, 500mL, 1L). Toggle between ounces and milliliters. View progress bar showing percentage of daily hydration goal. Water tracking is essential for fitness but often overlooked in calorie apps.</p>

        <h3>Custom Foods and Recipe Builder</h3>
        <p>Create unlimited custom foods with manual nutrition entry. Build recipes from ingredients with automatic per-serving calculations. Search common foods database or scan barcodes to add recipe ingredients. Save recipes for future quick logging. Perfect for home cooking and meal prep.</p>

        <h3>Motivation Without Manipulation</h3>
        <p>Light achievements and streaks without anxiety. No dark patterns, no forced engagement, no upsells disguised as features. Retention through respect and usefulness, not psychological manipulation. Built for people who want tools, not games.</p>

        <h2>How Free Calorie Track Works</h2>
        <p>Set up your profile with age, sex, height, weight, and activity level. Free Calorie Track calculates your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) using the clinically-validated Mifflin-St Jeor equation. TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is calculated by multiplying BMR by your activity factor. Choose a fitness goal (muscle gain, fat loss, maintenance, athletic performance) for automatic macro targets based on sports nutrition research, or set custom macro goals.</p>

        <p>Log food by scanning barcodes, searching the database, selecting from 2,000+ common foods, or creating custom entries. Macros (protein, carbs, fat) are automatically tracked with real-time progress bars. Log exercise from 250+ activities for accurate calorie burn using MET (Metabolic Equivalent) values. Track water intake throughout the day. View NET calories on dashboard showing true energy balance.</p>

        <p>Access trends to see weekly and monthly averages for calories and macros. View weight progress charts. Edit any past day without restrictions. Export all data as JSON backup file for safekeeping or device transfers. All data stays on your device for complete privacy.</p>
