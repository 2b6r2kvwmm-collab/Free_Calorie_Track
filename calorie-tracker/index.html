A net of zero means maintenance. Negative net means a deficit and you will lose weight over time. Positive net means a surplus and you will gain weight. Most apps show gross calories eaten without factoring in what your body burns, which makes the number misleading. Free Calorie Track shows the real picture."

TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is your total daily burn, which includes BMR plus the energy spent on daily movement, activity, and digestion. TDEE is the number that actually matters for tracking, because it is the baseline your food intake gets compared against. Free Calorie Track calculates both using the widely used Mifflin-St Jeor equation."

They may also show ads to free-tier users. Free Calorie Track includes these features at no cost, requires no account, shows no ads, and stores your data locally on your device rather than requiring cloud storage."

It runs as a Progressive Web App, which means no app store fees. It is kept alive by optional donations from people who find it useful. The goal was never to build a business — it was to build the calorie tracker that the developer wished existed."
