  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026<br>Last reviewed: February 5, 2026</p>

  <p><strong>Free Calorie Track</strong> is designed to respect your privacy. The app does not require an account, does not sell personal data, and stores your nutrition data locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Free Calorie Track does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or physical address.</p>

  <p>All food logs, calorie entries, macro targets, and history data are stored locally on your device using browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB). This data does not leave your device unless you choose to export or delete it.</p>

  <p><strong>Your nutrition data remains in your browser's local storage indefinitely until you manually delete it or clear your browser data. The app does not automatically delete old entries.</strong></p>

  <p>When you search for foods or scan barcodes, the app queries the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" target="_blank">Open Food Facts</a> database (a public, open-source nutrition database). These requests may include the barcode number or search terms you enter. Open Food Facts may log IP addresses and search queries according to their own <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Analytics</h2>
  <p>Free Calorie Track uses <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Vercel Analytics</a> to understand general usage patterns, such as page views and feature usage. This data is aggregated and does not identify individual users.</p>

  <p>Vercel Analytics does not use advertising cookies and does not track users across websites.</p>

  <h2>3. Camera Access</h2>
  <p>The barcode scanner feature requires access to your device's camera. Camera access is only used when you explicitly activate the scanner and is not used for any other purpose. <strong>No camera images or video are stored, transmitted, or analyzed</strong> beyond scanning barcodes in real-time on your device.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The app uses local storage and other technical browser features strictly necessary for the app to function (for example, saving your logs and preferences).</p>

  <p>It does not use cookies for advertising, profiling, or cross-site tracking.</p>

  <h2>5. Payments, Donations, and Affiliate Links</h2>
  <p>Free Calorie Track is supported through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optional donations via <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/" target="_blank">Buy Me a Coffee</a></li>
    <li>Affiliate links (such as Amazon Associates)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Free Calorie Track does not process payments directly and does not have access to your payment information.</strong> If you choose to support the app or click an affiliate link, the transaction occurs entirely on third-party websites. These third parties have their own privacy policies governing how your data is handled.</p>

  <h2>6. Hosting and Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>The app is hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Vercel</a>. The domain is registered through Cloudflare. These providers may process limited technical information (such as IP addresses) as part of normal website delivery and security operations.</p>

  <p><strong>International Data Transfers:</strong> Vercel operates globally and may process data in the United States and other countries. By using Free Calorie Track, you consent to this processing.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access your data</strong> – Use the Export feature in Settings to download all your data in JSON format</li>
    <li><strong>Delete your data</strong> – Clear your data via browser settings or the app's Settings page</li>
    <li><strong>Export your data</strong> – Download your data for portability to other apps</li>
    <li><strong>Opt out of analytics</strong> – Use browser settings, ad blockers, or Do Not Track settings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To exercise these rights, use the Settings page within the app or contact us at <a href="mailto:FreeCalorieTrack@gmail.com">FreeCalorieTrack@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. California and U.S. State Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information is collected, request deletion, and opt-out of "sales" of personal information.</p>

  <p><strong>We do not sell personal information.</strong> The app stores data locally on your device and does not share it with third parties except as described in this policy (Open Food Facts API queries and Vercel Analytics).</p>

  <p>For more information or to exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:FreeCalorieTrack@gmail.com">FreeCalorieTrack@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Free Calorie Track is intended for adults and users aged 13 and older. While the app is not designed specifically for children, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

  <p>If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date at the top.</p>

  <p>Material changes will be communicated via the app or website. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
