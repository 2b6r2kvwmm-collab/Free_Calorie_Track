    <p class="caps">Important: Free Calorie Track is a tool for informational and tracking purposes only. It is NOT intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.</p>

    <p>The calorie calculations and nutrition information are <strong>estimates</strong> based on standard formulas and may not be accurate for your individual circumstances. Calorie needs vary based on metabolism, health conditions, medications, and other factors not captured by this app.</p>

  <p>Donations are voluntary and non-refundable. Donations do not create any warranty, support obligation, or guarantee of future features.</p>

  <p>When you make a purchase through affiliate links (such as Amazon Associates), we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you. These commissions help support the development and hosting of Free Calorie Track.</p>

  <p><strong>Affiliate relationships do not influence the features, recommendations, or information provided by the app.</strong> Using affiliate links does not create any additional obligations or warranties.</p>

  <h2>10. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
  <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>

  <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the app shall be resolved through <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court.</p>

  <p><strong>You waive your right to a jury trial and to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.</strong></p>

  <p>This arbitration clause does not apply to disputes that can be resolved in small claims court or disputes related to intellectual property rights.</p>

  <p>The arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding, and judgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

  <p>For users outside the United States, these Terms shall apply to the extent permitted by your local law. Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a consumer that cannot be waived or limited by contract.</p>

  <h2>12. Export Control</h2>
  <p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations. You may not use or export the app in violation of U.S. export laws and regulations or the laws of the country in which you reside.</p>

  <h2>13. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent authority, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h2>14. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and the developer regarding use of the app and supersede any prior agreements or understandings.</p>

  <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
